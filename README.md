# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-
I have made tic tac toe game using GUI and tkinter libraries of python . Why Tkinter because it is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Import the Tkinter module. 
What is GUI?
A GUI (graphical user interface) is a system of interactive visual components for computer software. A GUI displays objects that convey information and represent actions that can be taken by the user. The objects change color, size, or visibility when the user interacts with them.

A GUI is considered to be more user-friendly than a text-based command-line interface, such as MS-DOS, or the shell of Unix-like operating systems.GUI objects include icons, cursors, and buttons. These graphical elements are sometimes enhanced with sounds, or visual effects like transparency and drop shadows.

When we execute the code, we get the desired output i.e. the gui of “TIC TAC TOE” game.
